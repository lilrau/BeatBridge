## Important
This tool was created to solve my problem with my playlists across different music apps. I'm gradually trying to expand it so that everyone can use it.

‚ö†Ô∏è The YouTube API has an annoying quota system that severely limits the number of requests the tool can make. I'm trying to find a solution to this, but I wonder if there is one. If you know of anything, please contact me.
